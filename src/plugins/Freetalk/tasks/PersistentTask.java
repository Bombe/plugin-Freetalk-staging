/**
 * A PersistentTask is a user notification which is stored in the database as long as it is valid.
 * It has stored:
 * - A time after which the process() function of the task shall be called.
 * - A time after which it shall be displayed to the user on the web interface, this can be updated by process().
 * - A time after which it should be deleted, this can be updated by process().
 * 
 * An example for a task is: For each OwnIdentity, there should be a {@link WoTIntroduceIdentityTask} which tells the
 * user to solve introduction puzzles if the identity is not published in enough trust lists.
