/**
 * A MessageRating is an assignment of a "good" / "bad" value from a {@link FTOwnIdentity} to a {@link Message}.
 * 
 * MessageRating objects are stored in the database.
 * There can only be one rating in the database for each message, therefore if the message is posted to multiple {@link Board}s and you rate it in one
 * board you cannot rate it in any other boards.
 * 
 * Message ratings are supposed to have an effect on plugin which Freetalk uses for obtaining identities from.
 * MessageRating is an abstract class so what this effect actually is depends on the implementation which is used.
 * 
 * Activation policy: MessageRating does automatic activation on its own.
 * This means that MessageRating can be activated to a depth of only 1 when querying them from the database.
 * All methods automatically activate the object to any needed higher depth.
