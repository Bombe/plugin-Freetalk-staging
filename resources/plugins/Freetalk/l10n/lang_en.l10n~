CreateIdentityWizard.ContinueButton=Continue
CreateIdentityWizard.RetryButton=Try to create it again
CreateIdentityWizard.Step1.Header=Step 1 of 3: Choose the SSK URI
CreateIdentityWizard.Step1.Text=The SSK URI of your identity is a public-private keypair which uniquely identifies your identity on the network. You can either let Freenet generate a new, random one for you or enter an existing SSK URI pair - for example if you own a Freesite you can re-use it's URI to show others that your identity belongs to your Freesite.
CreateIdentityWizard.Step1.GenerateNewKeyPairRadio=Generate a new, random SSK keypair for the identity.
CreateIdentityWizard.Step1.UseExistingKeyPairRadio=I want to use an existing SSK URI keypair for the identity.

CreateIdentityWizard.Step3.Header=Step 3 of 3: Choose your preferences
CreateIdentityWizard.Step3.TrustList.Header=Trust list
CreateIdentityWizard.Step3.TrustList.Text1=Trust lists are the ${bold}fundament of Freetalk${/bold}: You can publish a ${bold}trust value${/bold} for every identity in your trust list. The trust value can be between -100 and +100 inclusive and is a measurement for how valuable you rate the messages of an identity. If someone posts spam, you can give a negative trust value, if he writes useful posts, you can assign a positive one.
CreateIdentityWizard.Step3.TrustList.Text2=For every identity, Freetalk will accumulate trust values which it has received by other identities and calculate a ${bold}score${/bold} - a weighted average - from those. If the score of an identity is negative, Freetalk will not download messages from that identity anymore (unless you tell it to do so). Therefore, the purpose of the trust system is to ${bold}prevent spam${/bold} but it is ${bold}not to punish authors for having a different opinion than yours${/bold}. Please respect that when assigning trust values.
CreateIdentityWizard.Step3.TrustList.Text3=Here you can choose whether Freetalk should publish a trust list for your identity. It is generally a good idea because it helps the other users. However you can tell Freetalk not to publish your trust list if you are concerned that it might compromise your anonymity because the trust values among several of your identities might be similar.
CreateIdentityWizard.Step3.TrustList.PublishTrustListCheckbox=Publish the trust list of the identity
CreateIdentityWizard.Step4.Header=Identity created
CreateIdentityWizard.Step4.Success=Your identity was successfully created. You can log in with it now.
CreateIdentityWizard.Step4.Failure=Sorry, there was a problem creating your identity
Common.WebOfTrust.Score=Effective Trust

Common.WebOfTrust.PositiveGivenTrustsCount.Description=The number of identities which this identity trusts. This is the number of given trust values greater than or equal to 0.
Common.WebOfTrust.NegativeGivenTrustsCount.Description=The number of identities which this identity does not trust. This is the number of given trust values less than 0.
IntroduceIdentityPage.EnoughPuzzlesSolved.Header=Identity introduced
IntroduceIdentityPage.EnoughPuzzlesSolved.Text=You have solved enough puzzles. In theory, the next day your identity should be visible to others. Freetalk will tell you to solve more puzzles if it is not.

IntroduceIdentityPage.IntroduceIdentity.Submit=Submit

IntroduceIdentityPage.TaskWasPostponed.Text=Freetalk will not tell you to solve puzzles anymore until 24 hours have passed.
LoginPage.CookiesRequired.Text=You have to enable cookies in your browser for the log in to work. No permanent cookies are created, only such which expire after an hour.
LoginPage.Welcome.Header=Welcome to Freetalk
LoginPage.Welcome.Text1=Freetalk is a pseudo-anonymous messaging system based on Freenet. It is very similar to internet forums and newsgroups. Pseudo-anonymous means that you post your messages using an 'identity' which is uniquely identitfied by it's Freetalk address which consists of a nickname and an unique cryptography key.
LoginPage.Welcome.Text2=Because you can keep the private part of the cryptography key (the insert URI) secret, only you can post under your Freetalk address, which means that everyone knows that all messages from your identity probably come from the same author, therefore you are ${bold}pseudo${/bold}-anonymous.
LoginPage.Welcome.Text3=But due to the nature of Freenet, nobody will know who is the real person inserting the messages of your identity, which means that you as a real person are still an ${bold}anonymous author${/bold}.
